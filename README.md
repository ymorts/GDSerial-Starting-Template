# GDSerial-Starting-Template
A template script to read and utilize serial inputs in Godot with GDSerial
Import the scene and script into your project. You may either:
- instance it as a node in whichever scene you'd like to receive Serial information, and send a signal to another script in the scene that needs it through the inspector
- modify the code and send it as a global signal, and write to receive it as you need

# Dependencies
